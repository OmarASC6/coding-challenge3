FizzBuzz
Create a function fizzBuzz which takes an positive integer as a parameter and
returns an array of each integer from 1 up to this parameter included. Each number
divisible by 3 will be replaced by "Fizz", each number divisible by 5 will be
replaced by "Buzz", and each number divisible by 3 and 5 will be
replaced by "FizzBuzz". The input will always be > 0.
Examples:
console.log(fizzBuzz(15)) // returns [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz",7,8,"Fizz","Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]
